Clone the repository to your local machine to get started with Bookmark.ai.

cd CS510-Final-Project
```

### Step 2: Install Requirements
Install the necessary requirements using pip:

### Step 3: Set Up Chrome Extension
Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your Google Chrome browser, ensure that the Developer Mode is enabled at the top right corner, then click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder of the cloned repository to upload.

### Step 4: Configure API Key
Open the `server.py` file in a text editor and enter your API key for the Cohere model at the designated line:
```
api_key = "YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY"
```
